## ðŸ“– Overview of dataset

The dataset contains 400 blood smear images along with their annotation files. Each image is resized to ```640 x 480``` resolution. 

Datasets have three kinds of labels :
  * RBC (Red Blood Cell)
  * WBC (White Blood Cell)
  * Platelets

From this [dataset](https://github.com/Shenggan/BCCD_Dataset), [nicolaschen1](https://github.com/nicolaschen1) developed two Python scripts to make preparation data (CSV file and images) for recognition of abnormalities in blood cells on medical images.

- export.py: it creates the file "test.csv" with all data needed: filename, class_name, x1,y1,x2,y2.
- plot.py: it plots the boxes for each image and save it in a new directory.
